## Homework 1
- [In this homework](Homework1.html) we are asked to investigate the dimensionality and sample size effects on a dataset and also to do some manipulations on images. In the first part, I defined functions to generate uniformly random numbers with different dimensions and sizes. After generation, I performed some operations like counting the numbers to find the fraction of points inside a n-sphere inscribing n-cube. To find the distances between the points, I used euclidian distance from scipy library. Using those information, I estimated the number pi. Lastly, I calculated the minimum distances of each point to each point in 100 extra instances and tried to show the curse of dimensionality. In the second part, I performed some manipulations on an image of mine in the size of 512x512 pixels using the matplotlib library.

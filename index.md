- [This](https://github.com/BU-IE-582/Bugra-Taksuk-Progress-Journal) is the BuÄŸra's Progress Journal for the course IE582, it includes examples, related codes and report regarding the course material which is Statistical Learning for Data Mining

## Homework 1
- [In this homework](Homework1.html) we are asked to investigate the dimensionality and sample size effects on a dataset and also to do some manipulations on images. In the first part, I defined functions to generate uniformly random numbers with different dimensions and sizes. After generation, I performed some operations like counting the numbers to find the fraction of points inside a n-sphere inscribing n-cube. To find the distances between the points, I used euclidian distance from scipy library. Using those information, I estimated the number pi. Lastly, I calculated the minimum distances of each point to each point in 100 extra instances and tried to show the curse of dimensionality. In the second part, I performed some manipulations on an image of mine in the size of 512x512 pixels using the matplotlib library. 

## Homework 2
- [In this homework](Homework_2 (4).html) we are asked to perform some dimensionality reduction operations via PCA and MDS using different similarity measure with different datasets.In the first part, I applied PCA, MDS with euclidean distance and MDS with manhattan distance to see whether the classes are easy to differ or not. Then I compared these results. In the second part, I tried to reconstruct the Turkey map by reducing the distance matrix of the Turkey applying PCA. Lastly for the final part, I used distance occured(location) on 3D plot and most of the visualizations seemed similar to the gestures in the homework definition and for the b part I reduced the dimension of instances by using PCA. The data we worked on for the gesture recognition was from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/13553neknux7U8why55KM1WrjgkA9IJKm .
